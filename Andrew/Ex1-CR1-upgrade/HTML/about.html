            I used to play the <span>violin</span> everyday but now my fingers are tired from coding.
            <span>Music</span> was a super fun career until I had kids and realised there were more
            mouths to feed than just my own. A friend of mine told me the world needs more 
            web developers and suggested I find a boot camp. at first I thought it was a
            <span><em>crazy</em> idea</span> but then Covid-19 happened and finished off the 
            dying embers of an already dwindling career in which teaching had long since overtaken 
            performing. In French you would say <span><i>C'est la vie!</i></span> That means "Such is life"
            although it literally means "that/it <i>is</i> life" just like you would say in English.
            Languages are important and interesting to study but sometimes I think they
            are just imaginary barriers between people who are kind of just the same...
